This is the sample of the app created for my company which integrates
the collections of SOPs (Standard Operational Procedure).

It provides a more visually pleasing way of accessing documents in one place.

The app can be run from main.py by downloading Project_Files, or a single file executable can be 
created:

Make sure pyinstaller is installed on the machine or run - pip install pyinstaller

1) Navigate to the Program_Files directory from the shell.
2) open main.spec and insert your directory path into pathex.
3) RUN - pyinstaller main.spec.

Two folders will be created  - dist and build.
Go inside the dist and cut out the executable.
The rest of the files can be deleted.
